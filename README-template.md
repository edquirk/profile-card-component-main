## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used CSS custom properties using the :root however not sure where all the colors were supposed to go as there were 4 colors provided.

I learned how to add an image over another image.

```css
:root {
  --Dark-Cyan: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  --Very-Dark-desaturated-blue: hsl(229, 23%, 23%);
  --Dark-grayish-blue: hsl(227, 10%, 46%);
  --Dark-gray: hsl(0, 0%, 59%);
}
```
